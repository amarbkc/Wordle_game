# Wordle_game
During my first semester, I developed a Wordle game as a class project. This game prompts users to specify the length of the word they'd like to guess. The program then randomly selects a word from a text file, and the user's objective is to decipher this concealed word within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback by highlighting which letters are a part of the word and are in the correct position, aiding players in refining their choices. If a guessed letter is both present in the word and correctly positioned, it will be displayed in green. If the letter is present in the word but not in the right location, it will appear in yellow. However, if the guessed letter is not a part of the word, it will be displayed in red.
